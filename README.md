# Early Detection of Loan Defaulters

Distribution of the loans is the core business part of almost every bank. Most loans are made on a secured basis, yet little is known about the relationship between collateral and credit risk. Several theoretical studies find that when borrowers have private information about risk, the lowest-risk borrowers tend to pledge collateral. In contrast, conventional wisdom holds that when risk is observable, the highest-risk borrowers tend to pledge collateral. Banks often rely on credit prediction models to determine whether to approve a loan request. To a bank, a good prediction model is necessary so that the bank can provide as much credit as possible without exceeding a risk threshold.
The failure or success of the banking industry depends largely on the industry’s ability to properly evaluate credit risk. Loan detection is very helpful for employee of banks as well as for the applicant

also. Loan Prediction System allows jumping to specific application so that it can be check on priority basis.
This project is exclusively for the managing authority of Bank/finance Company, whole process of prediction is done privately no stakeholders would be able to alter the processing. Result against Loan Id can be send to various department of banks so that they can take appropriate action on application. This helps all others department to carried out other formalities.

Determining the loan outcome, like many financial predictions, is clearly not an easy task. There are different factors or causes can result in a good loan turning into a bad loan.

Predicting loan defaulter may be possible and reducing risk will possible with current data science techniques but identifying willful defaulters becoming more challenging. There many algorithms exist in current industry. But most of the algorithms are not good at predicting defaulter though they collect all the data. In this paper we examine the two major classification techniques Naïve Bayesian classifier and Decision tress for the performance of classification predictive accuracy.
Limitations of Existing Research
• Data need to be more refined to get more accuracy with the current models.
• Identifying the right feature is time consuming when too much data is available.
Directions for Future Research
• There are many factors which influence credit risk of an individual. We have other classification algorithms such as neural networks, Bagging algorithm, Cost Sensitive Learning etc. There are 9 other parameters like gender, marital status, age can be used as to in detection of risk. Considering all these and building an application which will helps banks or lending companies in loan approval process.
